<p>This project shows a progression from the most basic <a href="http://expressjs.com">express</a>-based <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a> app to a testable project using <a href="http://requirejs.org/">requirejs</a> to share code between the client and the server.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>First, set up node to be in development mode:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">source env_vars.sh
</code></pre>

<p><em>(usually you don't want to put your environment variables in your repository, but this is an example app, with no sensitive environment variables)</em></p>

<p>Next, install all required node modules:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">npm install
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, ensure that <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">mocha</a> is available on the command line by installing it globally:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">sudo npm install -g mocha
</code></pre>

<h2 id="example-1">Example #1</h2>

<pre><code class="shell">node src/1.\ anonymous/app.js
</code></pre>

<p>Hit <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser... Note that we use <code>res.send</code> which takes the object you pass it and renders it into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> for the browser. This makes it really easy to create APIs for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a> calls - javascript is really good at consuming JSON.</p>

<h2 id="example-2">Example #2</h2>

<pre><code class="shell">node src/2.\ anonymous/app.js
</code></pre>

<p>Again, hit <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser...</p>

<p>Now, for something new! Run its tests:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">mocha src/2.\ anonymous/test.js
</code></pre>

<p>The key change in this example is that the endpoint handler has been factored into a separate file and object so that it can be tested outside of a full web server. With this method you can much more quickly test a lot of interesting cases without pulling up your web browser or another tool.</p>

<h2 id="example-3">Example #3</h2>

<pre><code class="shell">node src/3.\ class/app.js
</code></pre>

<p>Check out <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>... now we're using <a href="http://momentjs.com/">moment.js</a> to print out the time with a nice format. We're also constructing Routes as a class instead of a raw object - it has a constructor and a method added to its prototype object. This is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">javascript prototype inheritance</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's run its tests:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">mocha src/3.\ class/test.js
</code></pre>

<p>This time we're running two tests, and we're using <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">sinon.js</a> to replicate error conditions by replacing the moment object inside of the Routes class. This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a>, and is especially useful if the execution of the code would have consequences, like sending a text message or sending a request to another application.</p>

<h2 id="example-4">Example #4</h2>

<p>First let's run tests:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">mocha src/4.\ sharing\ code/both/test.js
</code></pre>

<p>Like before, we're running tests on a class. But this time, the files are organized into three categories: server, client and both. As you might expect, these folders describe where this code runs. This test will also run in the browser.</p>

<p>To do that, first run the server:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">node src/4.\ sharing\ code/server/app.js
</code></pre>

<p>Now at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> we're using a jade template to render an HTML page to the browser. The page uses require.js to pull down a set of javascript files, and then gives you a link to run the same tests we just ran on the command line.</p>

<p>The keys to his configuration are:</p>

<ol>
<li>we use the amdefine node module to replicate requirejs behavior on the server side</li>
<li>we configure require.js to provide javascript files when we request node modules like <code>moment</code></li>
<li>we ensure that any relative pathing is correct. node that test.js refers to './logic.js' in the same directory. As long as this is preserved in what is offered to the web, it will work.</li>
</ol>

<p>For production, <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html">r.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/almond">almond.js</a> can be used to eliminate the requirejs runtime and create standalone concatenated and optimized files for the client. Maybe if someone is really nice I'll provide that example next. :0)</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
